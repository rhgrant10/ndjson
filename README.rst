Features
--------

* familiar interface
* very small
* no dependencies
* works as advertised
* has tests


Usage
-----

``ndjson`` exposes the same api as the builtin ``json`` and ``pickle`` packages.

.. code-block:: python

    import ndjson

    # load from file-like objects
    with open('data.ndjson') as f:
        data = ndjson.load(f)

    # convert to and from objects
    text = ndjson.dumps(data)
    data = ndjson.loads(text)

    # dump to file-like objects
    with open('backup.ndjson', 'w') as f:
        ndjson.dump(items, f)


It contains ``JSONEncoder`` and ``JSONDecoder`` classes for easy
use with other libraries, such as ``requests``:

.. code-block:: python

    import ndjson
    import requests

    response = requests.get('https://example.com/api/data')
    items = response.json(cls=ndjson.Decoder)
